Instructions for using scripts:

1. Copy the script you want to use
2. Bookmark a random page
3. Edit the URL of the bookmark to the copied code
4. Give the bookmark a descriptive name (so that you know what it does)
5. Execute the script by clicking on the bookmark that contains it

If you are on a computer, you can also paste these scripts directly into the console in your browser's developer tools
